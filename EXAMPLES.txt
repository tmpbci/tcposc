Extremly easy tcposc OSC animation examples.

Examples are in Rebol
http://rebol.com 

jmonome.r :

rebol jmonome.r

Display a short animation on monome LEDs (8x8). Monomeserial is mandatory. As is, monome address must be set to /40h and monomeserial listening port to 8000. All these parameters can be changed by text editing jmonome.r. 

jtouchosc.r :

rebol jtouchosc.r

Display a longer animation on iPAD/iPhone. TouchOSC is mandatory, the two different setups display a 8x8 grid like monome 40h. You need to edit in jtouchosc.r the oscipOUT and osciportOUT lines accordingly to match the iPad/iPhone network adress.


Have fun !
